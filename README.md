# typeysounds
This is basically a python port of NoisyTyper [originally by Theo Watson](http://fffff.at/noisy-typer-a-typewriter-for-your-laptop/)

I couldn't get the original NoisyTyper to work on my Mac (outdated I think), although I got it working thanks to [this repository](https://github.com/iAladdin/NoisyTyper-Swift). I also threw some of the sounds from their repository into the the default preset, since I wanted to push the changes without having to worry about making my own sounds (which I'll eventually do).


# installation/usage

clone the repo, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, `python3 main.py`.
